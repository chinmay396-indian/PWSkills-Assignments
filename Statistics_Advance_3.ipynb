        "Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with estimating population parameters based on sample data. In many cases, it is impossible to collect data from an entire population, so instead, we collect data from a sample of that population and use it to make inferences about the population as a whole.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two types of estimation: point estimation and interval estimation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Point estimation involves using sample data to estimate a single value for a population parameter. This single value is called the point estimate. For example, if we want to estimate the population mean based on a sample of data, we can calculate the sample mean and use it as the point estimate for the population mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interval estimation involves using sample data to estimate a range of values for a population parameter. This range is called the confidence interval or interval estimate. The confidence interval is constructed in such a way that it contains the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence. For example, if we want to estimate the population mean with 95% confidence, we can calculate a confidence interval that includes the sample mean, along with a margin of error based on the sample size and standard deviation.\n",

        "Both point estimation and interval estimation are important tools in statistics because they allow us to make educated guesses about population parameters based on sample data. However, interval estimation provides more information than point estimation because it includes a range of plausible values for the population parameter, rather than just a single estimate."

        "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that is used to determine whether a hypothesis about a population parameter is supported by the evidence provided by a sample of data. In hypothesis testing, we start with a null hypothesis that represents the status quo or the default assumption. We then collect data and calculate a test statistic based on the sample. We compare the test statistic to a critical value or p-value, and if the test statistic is significantly different from the critical value or p-value, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of an alternative hypothesis.\n",

        "The importance of hypothesis testing lies in its ability to provide a systematic and objective way to make decisions based on data. It allows researchers and analysts to evaluate the validity of their hypotheses and draw conclusions based on empirical evidence. Without hypothesis testing, decisions would be based on intuition or assumptions, which could be incorrect and lead to incorrect conclusions. Hypothesis testing also helps to control the risk of making a Type I error (rejecting a true null hypothesis) or a Type II error (failing to reject a false null hypothesis). By setting a significance level and calculating a p-value, we can determine the likelihood of making each type of error and make informed decisions about the results."

        "Student’s t-distribution is a probability distribution used to estimate the mean of a normally distributed population in situations where the sample size is small or the population standard deviation is unknown. It was introduced by William Gosset, who wrote under the pseudonym \"Student\" in 1908.\n",
        "\n",
        "The t-distribution is similar to the normal distribution in shape but has heavier tails, which means it assigns more probability to extreme values. The shape of the t-distribution is determined by a parameter called degrees of freedom (df), which represents the number of independent observations in the sample. As the degrees of freedom increase, the t-distribution approaches the normal distribution.\n",

        "The t-distribution is used in hypothesis testing, where we test whether a sample mean is significantly different from a hypothesized population mean. It is also used in constructing confidence intervals for the population mean, where we use the sample mean and the standard error of the mean to estimate the range of likely values for the population mean.\n",

If the sample size is large (greater than or equal to 30) and the population standard deviation is known, we can use the normal distribution instead of the t-distribution."
